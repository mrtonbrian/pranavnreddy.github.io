*Designed and built for ECE 174 with professor [Piya Pal](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/profile?id=411).*

I built an classifier for the MNIST handwritten digits dataset using a linear least squares-based classifier.
The numerical routines were done using NumPy, and the design was left to me. 
The image below shows the performance of different activiation functions when used in a feature mapping.
