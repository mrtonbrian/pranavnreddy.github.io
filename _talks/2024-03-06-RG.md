A talk I gave as a part of the weekly reading group meetings of the [SOC Group](https://zhengy09.github.io/soclab.html), focusing on the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM), as well as the motivation, properties, and convergence of the ALM.

A copy of the slides can be found [here](/files/RG_06_03_2024_ALM.pdf).
