I am currently a student at the University of California, San Diego, studying Mathematics and Computer Engineering. 
I am mainly interested in convex optimization and probability theory, but I also hope to become much more familiar with algebra and control theory in the next few months.

I am a member of the [Scalable Optimization and Control Group](https://zhengy09.github.io/soclab.html) at UC San Diego under the supervision of Professor [Yang Zheng](https://zhengy09.github.io/index.html).
Professor Zheng and I are currently looking into interpolation conditions for weakly convex functions in order to apply the techniques of performance estimation developed by Adrien Taylor.

Outside of academics, my interests include working out, surfing, listening to music, watching the NFL and NBA, literature and writing for the [Muir Quarterly](https://themq.org/), UCSD's premier satire publication.
